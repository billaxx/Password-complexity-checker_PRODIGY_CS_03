# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python tool to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria. The tool provides detailed feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

## Features

- Evaluates password strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
- Provides specific feedback on how to improve weak or moderate passwords.
- Checks passwords based on:
  - Minimum length (8 characters).
  - Presence of at least one uppercase letter.
  - Presence of at least one lowercase letter.
  - Presence of at least one number.
  - Presence of at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password to check its strength.
Example
Input:
bash
Copy code
Enter a password to check its strength: Pass123
Output:
plaintext
Copy code
Password Strength: Moderate
Feedback:
- Password should include at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $).
Input:
bash
Copy code
Enter a password to check its strength: Pass123@
Output:
plaintext
Copy code
Password Strength: Strong
Your password is strong. Great job!
Password Strength Criteria
Strong: Meets all criteria.
Moderate: Meets 3-4 criteria.
Weak: Meets less than 3 criteria.
Notes
This tool is for educational purposes and basic password strength assessment.
It does not store or share passwords entered by the user.
A "strong" password is only one aspect of securityâ€”consider using a password manager and enabling multi-factor authentication for better protection.
